Project: Refactoring a Legacy website to be Responsive
This project will take you off-platform and get you started in your own developer environment! Never done that before? Not to worry - we’ve shared some resources to help you down below. This project can be completed entirely on your own - or, you can join our Community Discord 63 and find someone to work with! Jump to the community support section to hear more about this.

The project is broken down into a set of user stories 124 for you to follow. User stories are likely something you will see more and more of as you progress in your journey as a developer. They are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the individual using that feature. The goal of each user story is to describe to you, the developer, what the feature or application needs to do, while providing you with enough flexibility to determine the best way to make that happen.

Overview
Objective
You’ve just been hired at a company and your first task is to redesign the company’s legacy website 314 to be responsive and HTML5 compliant. The requirement is for it to be responsive not just in modern browsers but you must also support IE 11.

Pre-requisites
In order to complete this project, we suggest that you have familiarity with the content in the following courses or lessons on the Codecademy platform:

Introduction to HTML 25
Learn Responsive Design 293
Learn CSS 23
Suggested Technologies
Depending on where you are on your Path, there may be multiple technology options you can use to complete this project - we suggest the following:

Flexbox 149and/or
CSS Grid 53and/or
Media Queries 62
After learning Flexbox in the lesson linked above, Flexbox Froggy 110 is a fun game that will give you more practice in using flexbox before applying it to projects.
Project Tasks
Get started - hosting your project
Since you won’t be completing this project in the Codecademy learning environment, you’ll need to find somewhere else to host your project! We’ve listed our recommendations below. For more specific information on the set-up involved with either of these resources - visit our forums guide 49.

Repl.it 64: If you’re not quite ready to get into all of the nitty gritty details of setting up your own local developer environment, Repl.it is an amazing online tool that can help you spin one up a web-based development environment with the click of a button. For this project, you’ll need a Repl.it environment that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Visual Studio Code: If you’re excited & ready to set-up your own local environment, we’ve got your back too. Visual Studio Code is a popular open source text editor that you will set-up & configure on your own device and can be used to develop websites and applications locally before pushing to production.
Basic Requirements
Feature: Redesign company website to be responsive with support for IE 11 and HTML5 compliant.

Research Task: Research what sort of support IE 11 has for the technology you’ve chosen and determine what workarounds if any will be needed to work in IE 11.
Task: Practice using the chosen technology by refactoring previous projects. (Use previous projects completed on Codecademy platform i.e. Fashion Blog, Tea Cozy, Dasmotos arts & Craft)
Task: Refactor legacy application to meet HTML5 standards. Validation can be done via the W3C Validator 40. Find the legacy website source code here 139.
Task: Responsive Design checklist:
All assets (i.e images, fonts) load in IE 11, Firefox and Chrome.
Images scale proportionately to viewport size - no overflow.
There is no loss in interactivity when switching between browsers.
Content/text is readable between browsers.
Additional challenges
Tech Debt: The company style guide was recently modified to adhere to Block-Element-Modifier methodology when it comes to naming CSS selectors. To address some tech debt, you’ve been tasked with reorganizing the company website’s codebase to follow the BEM naming convention.

Research Task: Familiarize yourself with Block-Element-Modifier technology.
Task: Refactor previous projects to follow BEM to gain a better understanding of how to a codebase can be better organized using this methodology.
Task: Implement block element modifier methodology into the company’s website.
