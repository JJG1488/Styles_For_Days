<!-- GRID ESSENTIALS
Review
At this point, we’ve covered a great deal of different ways to manipulate the grid and the items inside it to create interesting layouts.

grid-template-columns defines the number and sizes of the columns of the grid
grid-template-rows defines the number and sizes of the rows of the grid
grid-template is a shorthand for defining both grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows in one line
row-gap puts blank space between the rows of the grid
column-gap puts blank space between the columns of the grid
gap is a shorthand for defining both row-gap and column-gap in one line
grid-row-start and grid-row-end makes elements span certain rows of the grid
grid-column-start and grid-column-end makes elements span certain columns of the grid
grid-area is a shorthand for grid-row-start, grid-column-start, grid-row-end, and grid-column-end, all in one line
You have seen how to set up and fill in a grid and you now have one more CSS positioning technique to add to your toolkit! Let’s do some practice to solidify these skills.

Instructions
1.
Let’s start by making this bunch of divs into a grid. In style.css, in the .grid ruleset, add a declaration that uses the display property along with the value necessary to make the element a CSS grid.

Structure the grid to have four columns — the first two each taking up 25% of the total width, the third column taking up two-thirds of the remaining space, and the last column taking up the last third of the remaining space.

Without using span, make the box with class a take up the first two rows of the grid.

Great! Now, feel free to play around with refactoring to see how short you can make your style.css file while not changing the layout we’ve created. When you’re ready, move on to the next lesson. In the next lesson, you will learn some advanced techniques to further style your CSS grids. -->
